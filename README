* cbm - Switch to similar buffers.

** Installation:

   Put cbm.el in your `load-path' and require it:

   (require 'cbm)

   The package is also available via `melpa' or `melpa-stable.

   It is recommended to bind `cbm-cycle', `cbm-switch-buffer' and
   `cbm-find-org-agenda-file', `cbm-rcirc-switch-to-channel' to a key:

   (global-set-key (kbd "C-;") #'cbm-cycle)
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-'") #'cbm-switch-buffer)
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") #'cbm-find-org-agenda-file)
   (define-key rcirc-mode-map (kbd "M-i") #'cbm-rcirc-switch-to-channel)

** Usage:

   This package provides useful commands for switching to similar
   buffers. It's particularly handy for switching between buffers in
   the same major mode.
